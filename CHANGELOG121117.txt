CHANGELOG

12112017

Functionality:

	Added code at end of obstacle detection for the OSV to turn towards the mission site.
	This will hopefully fix the issue we were having with the OSV getting stuck in an infinite loop behind obstacles.

Housekeeping:

	Overall, streamlined code for ease of use and less memory usage.
	See specifics below.

	Removed:
	missionState implementation (replaced with break())
	targetTheta
	errX
	errY

	Moved errTheta, and motorValue variable to turnTo() method

	Simplified code through implementation of moveForward() and stopMoving() methods.

	Added the following methods:
	checkPosition() : This method gets OSV position from the Enes100 vision system library
	moveForward(int power) : This method moves the OSV forward with minMotorValue<=power<=255
	stopMoving() : This method halts OSV drivetrain movement

	Added commented descriptions to the following methods:
	calcHeading()
	calcDistance()
	turnTo()
	checkPosition()
	moveForward()
	stopMoving()
